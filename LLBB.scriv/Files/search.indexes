            <Text>Carnie Corcoran
	•	Boxing and language 
	•	From: detroit, juggalo territory 
	•	The Woman 
	•	Height: 5’8 
	•	Hair Color: Deep red 
	•	3 Quotes: “I call myself a contemporary reaver. “I’m something, at least. I’ve got a mental image to match.” 
	•	Story Arc: Carnie’s goal is to be as cut up, beat up, and bruised up as she can manage while her body still works. She is very much about pushing herself to the extremes physically and proving to the world that she is insurmountable in this way. As the player goes down her route more, this is because when she was young, she was part of a human trafficking ring, and she felt so physically hopeless that she couldnâ€™t sustain herself she decided that she would become more powerful than any person she would ever meet. She doesnâ€™t remember exactly what it was like, that trauma is pretty locked away in her memory, but she does know that she made that promise to herself when she was at her lowest point. She is a student on financial aid. If you go on her path she imbibes in the player verbally the rush of fighting, the stimulant she craves. Sheâ€™s also not averse to drugs like cocaine and steroids if it means she can be stronger. Very, berserker build.  Especially deckbuilders. Sheâ€™s okay at speaking other languages but not as good at writing and reading them when they arenâ€™t in roman characters. Her inspirations are Guybrush Threepwood, Joan of Arc, and Violent J. 
	•	Relationships: 
	⁃	She doesn’t quite get along with Ernie because the reason that they hurt themselves is from such different sources, but they come to understand one another as the story develops.
	⁃	She likes playing board games with Vesuvius when he brings them to the Lingua Lounge, and she’s pretty good at them.
	⁃	Her and Urania get along because they both take their hobbies incredibly seriously, both seeking peek perfection and ability in either mental or physical state.
	⁃	Carnie and 
	⁃	Carnie finds Homer and Magus attractive. 
	•	Mannerisms: She literally just likeâ€¦ bites her knuckles sometimes until they bleed. She looks that it causes her more pain when sheâ€™s boxing. This mannerism is not explained until later when someone finally questions her about it. Sometimes she just mentions insane clown posse. When she does it makes everyone uncomfortable. Values academia, even though she has to work hard to overcome her lack of access to education prior LLBB. She has a history of alcoholism in her family and the fear of becoming an alcoholic is prevelant in her personality.

            <Text>	•	Radio and Mathematics 
	•	From: NYC, manhattan 
	•	Enbie fem 
	•	Height: 6â€™ 
	•	Hair Color: Dark blue 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	“Don’t touch that diode, my grandmother gave it to me and if you do you’ll be imbibed with her waking spirit. Is it a joke? I don’t know if I’m joking anymore.” 
	◦	“If you can listen closely to the radio waves, you will hear the songs of the deceased, and then you will hear how they dance and dance to the beat of life.” 
	•	Story Arc: You really get into machining if u go on her path, you get to learn about how sheâ€™s developing mass-communication radio transmitters that sync with brain waves. She is the â€œtrue path.â€ She also has a lot of internalized transphobia and it takes a while for her to come out as nonbinary to you, this connects with her inability to truely express how sheâ€™s feeling because it relates so intensely to her internal experience which is not open to you and others. 
	•	Mannerisms: Sheâ€™s always switching radio dials, has the attention span of a trout. She loves like the singing trout novelty item. Sheâ€™s a little depressed and morose, like she has thoughts that meander and if they do so for too long, they go into dark suicidal places, but she is never quite able to explain how she feels about these thoughts to other people in a way that feels cathartic for both her and the people she is explaining to. She hates Carmeline because she thinks Carmeline doesnâ€™t take the macabre seriously enough. She loves Sylvia Plath and Laurie Anderson. 
	•	Appearance: Butch style, has dark blue hair in dreads that fall down with good volume (sort of like gen but bigger), wears a fanny-pack over their chest as a sash-esque to keep their tools in.

            <Text>Who are the characters?

Carmeline Iodine
	•	Theater, Science 
	•	Manhattan 
	•	gorl 
	•	Height: 5'8 
	•	Hair Color: Violent Violet 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	"My medusa sings to the gods tonight.â€ 
	◦	â€œDid my performance send its intended shiver up your spinal column?" 
	◦	"Cripes, that's one for the corpses!" 
	•	Story Arc: Â  Player helps her get over her stage fright, she is very talented once she is confident and aware that people respect her seriousness as an actress 
	•	Mannerisms:Â  She's spooky. She loves scary novels. She takes herself very seriously. It is very fun to try and get her to laugh, but it is a little too easy to go too far. If the image she wants to exude is insulted, she goes quiet. She has hobbies other than theater, such as taxidermy, taxonomy, and field studies in biology. She also loves to knit, but only items for her taxidermied specimens. She has two separate registers, one is soprano and when she does this she mimics the theatrics of young Kate Bush. Her other register is contralto, and to activate this register she must drink five shots of â€œBangâ€ before performing. She really likes weird cadavers and creepy foetuses, sort of like the "crazy scientist" in a lab aesthetic, not in reality but in aesthetics. She is willowy and lanky, when one side of her body moves, the other matches it in reverse (if one hand moves up, the other goes down). She loves Mary Shelly and Ada Lovelace. 
	•	Appearance: Gangly, a long, orthodox dress, a little emo, maybe a chain somewhere? Think Kate Bush from Wuthering Heights 
 Vesuvius Rex
	•	Board games and language 
	•	From: Chicago 
	•	Scum man 
	•	Height: 5'8 
	•	Hair Color: Yellow with brown lowlights 
	•	3 Quotes:Â Â  
	◦	"By my calculations, you are pretty fucking cool." 
	◦	"Woah woah, hold on, I'm getting a beep-beep-beep read you are not about these semantics we are doing together right now." 
	◦	"If you were asking me, and you're not, but if you were to ask me, I would put that piece like about three spaces over, just for the best outcome, you know?" 
	•	Story Arc: Help him become one with the board game community, help him figure out why his ego is always in the way and why he feels its immediate he always wins the games he plays. This manifests in the way he treats other people as well, he min-maxes his surroundings in a way that is not healthy for human function. 
	•	Mannerisms:Â  He scratches his cheek when thinking, and he thinks a lot. He very much likes to one-up his peers with information he knows, or strategy. He thinks he's amazing at strategy but he isn't that amazing at strategy. He's okay at it. From a young age, because he wasn't great at sports, and because he was a boy, he has been conditioned to think he's a genius. At school he's okay, but he's good at board games because they're his favorite thing. He also is very interested in getting into BDSM culture, as itâ€™s a way he thinks he can explore his sexuality without â€œbeing gayâ€ and can play out his power fantasies in it. He's really good at learning languages, specifically weird words in them, though. He loves Vlaada Chvatil and Frank Zappa. 
	•	Appearance: short-sleeved trenchcoat, fingerless gloves, hair shaped like the kid in invader zim, maybe glasses? High cheekbones, some scruff, nicer pants, maybe steel toe shoes 

Bobby Bellows
	•	Football and English 
	•	From: Yeetville 
	•	boi 
	•	Height: 6'2 
	•	Hair Color: As brown as the range 
	•	3 Quotes:Â  
	◦	â€œFly! Eagles! Fly!â€ 
	◦	â€œWhy are you so invested in academia when it doesnâ€™t even matter in the end? Thatâ€™s just what the globalists want you to care about.â€ 
	◦	â€œI bet I could bench you.â€ 
	•	Story Arc: Â  Help him realize that being an underdog emotionally and being competent in his work can be healthy if one recognizes that not everything in life is "us vs them?" Maybe his arc is about getting over his urge to be a nationalist. Maybe talk about what it means to have a body, and like how people can process things similarly, maybe they get overwhelmed by the same things, maybe he gets overwhelmed by thinking about this? 
	•	Mannerisms:Â  He's just a little dumb. Although he's incredibly talented as a football player, he has always empathized with the "underdog" in all walks of life and feels like he is constantly in the position of the morally superior. With this, he believes it is paramount to be kind to all he meets, no matter their background or personality, and even behind closed doors he finds the good in all. He has a lot of health anxiety, actually. He loves Mark Twain. 

Urania Toaple
	•	Radio and Mathematics 
	•	From: NYC, manhattan 
	•	Enbie fem 
	•	Height: 6â€™ 
	•	Hair Color: Dark blue 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	Â â€œDonâ€™t touch that diode, my grandmother gave it to me and if you do youâ€™ll be imbibed with her waking spirit. Is it a joke? I donâ€™t know if Iâ€™m joking anymore.â€ 
	◦	â€œIf you can listen closely to the radio waves, you will hear the songs of the deceased, and then you will hear how they dance and dance to the beat of life.â€ 
	•	Story Arc: You really get into machining if u go on her path, you get to learn about how sheâ€™s developing mass-communication radio transmitters that sync with brain waves. She is the â€œtrue path.â€ She also has a lot of internalized transphobia and it takes a while for her to come out as nonbinary to you, this connects with her inability to truely express how sheâ€™s feeling because it relates so intensely to her internal experience which is not open to you and others. 
	•	Mannerisms: Sheâ€™s always switching radio dials, has the attention span of a trout. She loves like the singing trout novelty item. Sheâ€™s a little depressed and morose, like she has thoughts that meander and if they do so for too long, they go into dark suicidal places, but she is never quite able to explain how she feels about these thoughts to other people in a way that feels cathartic for both her and the people she is explaining to. She hates Carmeline because she thinks Carmeline doesnâ€™t take the macabre seriously enough. She loves Sylvia Plath and Laurie Anderson. 
	•	Appearance: Butch style, has dark blue hair in dreads that fall down with good volume (sort of like gen but bigger), wears a fanny-pack over their chest as a sash-esque to keep their tools in. 

Homer StytaxÂ 
	•	Â Writing, ScienceÂ  
	•	From: Cincinatti 
	•	Enbie masc 
	•	Height: 5'6 
	•	Hair Color: Moss Green 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	â€œI feel like there is never really anyone looking out for usâ€¦ except for us kids, we have to rely on each other. Maybe they want us to build a sense of camaraderie but honestly itâ€™ll just be nice to have the trauma in the future when weâ€™re old and bored and need something to look back upon.â€ 
	•	Story Arc: Homer wants to return to the sea, aka the canal where theyâ€™re always hanging out. They always like swimming and sitting in plants/dirt/nature. They write in mud and have great marks even though they never study. He also enjoys looking over other peopleâ€™s shoulders as they work, taking mental notes and singing limericks in his head about the thing they are doingâ€¦ he does this a lot with Carmeline especially. He is currently dealing the ongoing death of his mother, which has aged him quite a ton. He has a perspective on death and society that most of the other students will get later when they grow up, but he is no longer enthralled by beauties in society that oppress people (ie aesthetics of nazism or shinto nationalism or manifest destiny or british quaintness). In his poetry he writes a lot about these things and shows them to the player. He gives them a chance to respond similarly or reject his thoughts, and then he extrapolates how he feels when they react. 
	•	Mannerisms: Homer sighs a lot, as if weighed down by the world, ready to sink into it and sleep forever. It is as if he is Atlas but reverse, a gravity pulls him in instead of him suspending the world upon his shoulders. Their inspirations are Atlas, Kurt Vonnegut, Danielle Bunten-Berry, and Contrapoints. 

Magus LiuÂ 
	•	Fencing, English 
	•	From: Massachusetts 
	•	Height: 6â€™0 
	•	enbie 
	•	Hair Color: Raven's Wing 
	•	3 Quotes:Â  
	◦	â€œIf you come with me this far, itâ€™s ride or die. Can you handle it?â€ 
	•	Story Arc: Wants to slay a dragon or a giant monster, in the contemporary world this is the government or corporations. Major environmental and anti-ICE activist. Is very willing to make themselves the hero, has a bit of a complex about it. But, this can make them expect others to be an accessory to their story. You the player join them through political protest and civil disobedience, you all get really into it. The player becomes better at support skills or attack skills depending on how they interact w magus in this route.Â  
	•	Mannerisms: Loves movement, loves lunging. A whispy voice, lots of side-eyeing, chews on their lips, loves chapstick 
	•	Appearance: Wirey, elegant, but muscular. Wears an open shirt, you can see their chest. Long, black hair.    
Rosemary Looma
	•	Photography, Mathematics 
	•	From: Suburbia 
	•	That woman 
	•	Height: 5â€™6 
	•	Hair Color: Milky blonde 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	•	Story Arc: Rosemary is incredibly shy and as you get to know her, you find she has a blooming ED. her character is watching her fall, she eventually has to go to a psyche ward to deal w it. She is an antithesis to Homer, the plant person but in a very different way, she is particular and mathematic about plants, growth, and change. 
	•	Mannerisms: Cannot get over selfies. Very into the Fibonacci sequence and plants, growing them, photographing them. Is vegan. Loves dark room photography and makes jokes about dipping her hands in the development chemicals. 

Â Â Vokuro Vertabrae
	•	Gardening, History 
	•	From: montreal

Carnie Corcoran
	•	Boxing and language 
	•	From: detroit, juggalo territory 
	•	The Woman 
	•	Height: 5â€™8 
	•	Hair Color: Deep red 
	•	3 Quotes: â€œI call myself a contemporary reaver. Iâ€™m something, at least. Iâ€™ve got a mental image to match.â€ 
	•	Story Arc: Carnieâ€™s goal is to be as cut up, beat up, and bruised up as she can manage while her body still works. She is very much about pushing herself to the extremes physically and proving to the world that she is insurmountable in this way. As the player goes down her route more, this is because when she was young, she was part of a human trafficking ring, and she felt so physically hopeless that she couldnâ€™t sustain herself she decided that she would become more powerful than any person she would ever meet. She doesnâ€™t remember exactly what it was like, that trauma is pretty locked away in her memory, but she does know that she made that promise to herself when she was at her lowest point.

This manifests in the way he treats other people as well, he min-maxes his surroundings in a way that is not healthy for human function. 
	•	Mannerisms:Â  He scratches his cheek when thinking, and he thinks a lot. He very much likes to one-up his peers with information he knows, or strategy. He thinks he's amazing at strategy but he isn't that amazing at strategy. He's okay at it. From a young age, because he wasn't great at sports, and because he was a boy, he has been conditioned to think he's a genius. At school he's okay, but he's good at board games because they're his favorite thing. He also is very interested in getting into BDSM culture, as it’s a way he thinks he can explore his sexuality without being gay and can play out his power fantasies in it. He's really good at learning languages, specifically weird words in them, though. He loves Vlaada Chvatil and Frank Zappa. 
	•	Appearance: short-sleeved trenchcoat, fingerless gloves, hair shaped like the kid in invader zim, maybe glasses? High cheekbones, some scruff, nicer pants, maybe steel toe shoes

            <Text>What places exist in LiverLung?
The School
	•	The science lab (Carmeline, Homer) 
	◦	The science lab is filled with cadavers, foetuses in jars, animal bones, and petrified wood on one side. On the other side is the fumigation station and the chemical closet. Homer spends most of his time bouncing between the two sides, trying to find comparisons, thinking deeply, attempting to aid carmeline with experiments. Carmeline spends most of her time writing out equations and very rarely actually coming to conclusions on the things she has written, usually she must be prompted by Homerâ€™s goading. When she is alone she sings to herself while working. 
	◦	This lab has not been properly inspected for a long time and none of the teachers on the LiverLung board of safety really care. There are no warnings up, Homer makes notes of this a lot, he says he finds it funny but you assume that in reality, he feels abandoned and unsafe. Carmeline likes that no one, other than Homer who she has minioned, in her business while she experiments, but sometimes, when an experiment goes wrong, she does wish that the eye flushing station could turn on with more alacrity. It tends to spew some sludge out of very old pipes before clean water can come through. 
	•	The costume closet (Carmeline) 
	•	The shed (you) 
	•	The computation room (Urania, Rosemary) 
	•	The writing den (Bobby, Magus) 
	•	The lingua lounge (Vesuvius, Carnie) 
	•	The teacher’s offices 
	•	The school radio center (Urania) 
	•	The weight room (Bobby, Magus, Carnie) 
	•	The football field(Bobby) 
	•	The back field (Homer) 
	•	The dark room (Rosemary) 
	•	The secret garden (All characters can be found here once) 
	•	You don’t level up their friendship but talking to them here unlocks a special skill. The day every character is here is important to that character and the screen is poignant. 

The Town (Rosemary can be found in many of the town places)
	•	The public theater (Carmeline) 
	•	The river (Homer) 
	•	Extro-Terrestrial Activities (Vesuvius) 
	•	The public telecommunications building (Urania) 
	•	The boxing ring/the pit (Carnie)
	⁃	Various creeps and brawny musculars hang out around The Pit. This is similar to the Battle Brawler arena, except instead of being a showcase place for combatatorial teamwork, bets are made on who can hurt who the most. 
	•	The Watered Melon (Carnie, Vesuvius, Magus) 
	•	The Diner (Bobby, Magus)

	•	From: Yeetville 
	•	boi 
	•	Height: 6'2 
	•	Hair Color: As brown as the range 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	“Fly! Eagles! Fly!” 
	◦	“Why are you so invested in academia when it doesn’t even matter in the end? That’s just what the globalists want you to care about.” 
	◦	“I bet I could bench you.” 
	•	Story Arc: Help him realize that being an underdog emotionally and being competent in his work can be healthy if one recognizes that not everything in life is "us vs them?" Maybe his arc is about getting over his urge to be a nationalist. Maybe talk about what it means to have a body, and like how people can process things similarly, maybe they get overwhelmed by the same things, maybe he gets overwhelmed by thinking about this? 
	•	Mannerisms: He's just a little dumb. Although he's incredibly talented as a football player, he has always empathized with the "underdog" in all walks of life and feels like he is constantly in the position of the morally superior. With this, he believes it is paramount to be kind to all he meets, no matter their background or personality, and even behind closed doors he finds the good in all. He has a lot of health anxiety, actually. He loves Mark Twain.

            <Title>Carnie Corcoran</Title>
            <Text>Week1
Carnie is mainly found in the Lingua Lounge during this week. She is chipper, talks to you about boxing. She plays board games with Vesuvius Rex.

Week2
When she is here, Carnie is very brief with you.  Brief, not rude. She’s busy with SOMETHING. She will refuse to tell you what it is. You will find her in the weight room. For some reason, she seems to be training like the end of the world is coming. She has a feeling under her skin that something big is about to happen to her but she has no idea what, no way to verbalize it. She says that she’s ready to join the boxing ring of the local town, Liver Lung, and that she needs to prove that she should be there and part of the reaving community.

Week3
Carnie is found in the pit, where she is talking to other patrons. She seems to be looking for a sponsor/coach. One man she talks to specifically, he is that man that will be associated with her kidnapping. If you try to talk to Carnie during this time she will tell you to fuck off, but obviously she is not saying this because she hates you. She is trying to adhere to the social pressure this man is placing upon her to isolate herself from her peers. Near the two of them on the floor is a paper with an address, this is where she will be taken to next week.

Week4
Carnie is kidnapped and cannot be found around town. This is a major plot-point, people are constantly talking about how she hasn’t come to class. She has been kidnapped by the man she was talking to last week.

Week5
Amongst the students, Major panic ensues because Carnie is gone, but no one knows what to do about it. The administration says that the police are involved but there are no leads. The player is powerless in this situation because they are not a vigilante. The player may encounter Bobby, Vesuvius, and Ernie talking together at the Radio Center while Urania sits and listens to shit, and they will give a plethora of clues they have collected about Carnie’s disappearance. This week, if the player keeps going to them, it leads up to solving a mystery that never culminates.

Week6
Carnie appears on Sunday, you come into school learning that she has returned. If you talk to her about it this week she acts like nothing has happened. Bobby, Vesuvius, and Ernie, if you talk to any of them, will gossip to you about it. Urania is the one that actually knows what happened to Carnie as they are very close with them. They will tell you this and they will tell you that they will not tell you what happened.

Week7
Carnie is very stressed about midterms because she feels behind on school. You have the option to help her study or not. She can be found in the Lingua Lounge. It is impossible to talk to her about anything that doesn’t have to do with school, it’s almost as if she is hiding her response to the kidnapping, she will not crack.

Week8
Carnie will not talk, her appearance is obviously tired.

Week9
Carnie can be found at the pit, beating her irritation out onto some poor man.

Week10
If the player has not spent a lot of time with Carnie, they will find her making out with someone in the back field. If they have spent a lot of time with her, she will invite them to make out with her at the back field. She is not emotionally attached to them yet, she is just horny, she says.

Week11
Carnie can be found at the pit, throughout the conversation the player notices that she’s started drinking a bit. She tends to gossip a lot (about vesuvius, about other things) and does not acknowledge having slept with anyone, whether the player or not.

	•	Manhattan 
	•	gorl 
	•	Height: 5'8 
	•	Hair: Violent Violet, it is shorter at her chin and incredibly wirey # 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	"My medusa sings to the gods tonight.” 
	◦	“Did my performance send its intended shiver up your spinal column?" 
	◦	"Cripes, that's one for the corpses!" 
	•	Story Arc: Player helps her get over her stage fright, she is very talented once she is confident and aware that people respect her seriousness as an actress. Her mom is dying from brain cancer and it puts her in a depression. 
	•	Mannerisms: She's spooky. She loves scary novels. She takes herself very seriously. It is very fun to try and get her to laugh, but it is a little too easy to go too far. If the image she wants to exude is insulted, she goes quiet. She has hobbies other than theater, such as taxidermy, taxonomy, and field studies in biology. She also loves to knit, but only items for her taxidermied specimens. She has two separate registers, one is soprano and when she does this she mimics the theatrics of young Kate Bush. Her other register is contralto, and to activate this register she must drink five shots of “Bang” before performing. She really likes weird cadavers and creepy foetuses, sort of like the "crazy scientist" in a lab aesthetic, not in reality but in aesthetics. She is willowy and lanky, when one side of her body moves, the other matches it in reverse (if one hand moves up, the other goes down). She loves Mary Shelly and Ada Lovelace. 
	•	Appearance: Gangly, a long, orthodox dress, a little emo, maybe a chain somewhere? Think Kate Bush from Wuthering Heights energy, less appearance, more mannerism

	•	From: Cincinatti 
	•	Enbie masc, hates even being considered human 
	•	Height: 5'6 
	•	Hair Color: Moss Green 
	•	3 Quotes: 
	◦	“I feel like there is never really anyone looking out for us, except for us kids, we have to rely on each other. Maybe they want us to build a sense of camaraderie but honestly it’ll just be nice to have the trauma in the future when we’re old and bored and need something to look back upon.” 
	•	Story Arc: Homer wants to return to the sea, aka the canal where they’re always hanging out. They always like swimming and sitting in plants/dirt/nature. They write in mud and have great marks even though they never study. He also enjoys looking over other people’s shoulders as they work, taking mental notes and singing limericks in his head about the thing they are doing he does this a lot with Carmeline especially. He is currently dealing the ongoing death of his mother, which has aged him quite a ton. He has a perspective on death and society that most of the other students will get later when they grow up, but he is no longer enthralled by beauties in society that oppress people (ie aesthetics of nazism or shinto nationalism or manifest destiny or british quaintness). In his poetry he writes a lot about these things and shows them to the player. He gives them a chance to respond similarly or reject his thoughts, and then he extrapolates how he feels when they react. 
	•	Mannerisms: Homer sighs a lot, as if weighed down by the world, ready to sink into it and sleep forever. It is as if he is Atlas but reverse, a gravity pulls him in instead of him suspending the world upon his shoulders. Their inspirations are Atlas, Kurt Vonnegut, Danielle Bunten-Berry, and Contrapoints. They are what the river Styx would be personified as.</Text>
